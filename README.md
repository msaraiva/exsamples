# ExSamples

Initializes lists of maps, structs or keyword lists using tabular data in Elixir.

ExSamples helps you to describe data of the same type in a more **compact** and **readable** way. Specially useful when defining sample data (e.g. for tests). Here is an example:

```Elixir
countries = samples do
  :id | :name           | :currency                    | :language    | :population
   1  | "Brazil"        | "Real (BRL)"                 | "Portuguese" | 204_451_000
   2  | "United States" | "United States Dollar (USD)" | "English"    | 321_605_012
   3  | "Austria"       | "Euro (EUR)"                 | "German"     |   8_623_073
   4  | "Sweden"        | "Swedish krona (SEK)"        | "Swedish"    |   9_801_616
end

```

```
iex> countries |> Enum.at(1)
%{currency: "United States Dollar (USD)", id: 2, language: "English",
  name: "United States", population: 321605012}
```
> Disclaimer: This is a very experimental library. The main goal of this first version is to define the table format(s) and minimum functionality.

## Install

Add ExSamples as a dependency in your `mix.exs` file.

```elixir
def deps do
  [ { :exsamples, "~> 0.1.0" } ]
end
```

Run `mix deps.get`.

## Usage

You can see it in action with [livebook](https://livebook.dev/) with [README.livemd](README.livemd)

[![Run in Livebook](https://livebook.dev/badge/v1/blue.svg)](https://livebook.dev/run?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmsaraiva%2Fexsamples%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2FREADME.livemd)

```Elixir
import ExSamples

users = samples do
  :name       | :country        | :city           | :admin
  "Christian" | "United States" | "New York City" | false
  "Peter"     | "Germany"       | "Berlin"        | true
  "José"      | "Brazil"        | "São Paulo"     | false
  "Ingrid"    | "Austria"       | "Salzburg"      | false
  "Lucas"     | "Brazil"        | "Fortaleza"     | true      
end

for %{name: name, country: country, city: city} <- users, country == "Brazil" do
  {name, city}
end

# [{"José", "São Paulo"}, {"Lucas", "Fortaleza"}]
```

As you can see, after macro expansion you get a regular list. You can use `for` comprehensions for mapping and filtering your data just like with any other Enumerable.

By default `samples` initializes a list of maps. But you can also define structs and keyword lists.

### Initializing structs

```Elixir
import ExSamples

defmodule Country do
  defstruct [:id, :name, :currency, :language, :population]
end

countries = samples as: Country do
  :id | :name           | :currency                    | :language    | :population
   1  | "Brazil"        | "Real (BRL)"                 | "Portuguese" | 204_451_000
   2  | "United States" | "United States Dollar (USD)" | "English"    | 321_605_012    
end
```

### Initializing keyword lists

```Elixir
countries = samples as: [] do
  :id | :name           | :currency             | :language    | :population
   3  | "Austria"       | "Euro (EUR)"          | "German"     |   8_623_073        
   4  | "Sweden"        | "Swedish krona (SEK)" | "Swedish"    |   9_801_616
end
```

### Assigning variables as structs

```Elixir

defmodule Country do
  defstruct [:name, :currency, :language]
end

defmodule User do
  defstruct [:id, :name, :country, :admin, :last_login]
end

samples do
  Country  | :name           | :currency                    | :language
  country1 | "Brazil"        | "Real (BRL)"                 | "Portuguese"
  country2 | "United States" | "United States Dollar (USD)" | "English"
  country3 | "Austria"       | "Euro (EUR)"                 | "German"
end

samples do
  User  | :id | :name       | :country | :admin | :last_login
  user1 |  16 | "Lucas"     | country1 | false  | {2015, 10, 08}
  user2 | 327 | "Ingrid"    | country3 | true   | {2014, 09, 12}
  user3 |  34 | "Christian" | country2 | false  | {2015, 01, 24}
end

```

```
iex> IO.puts "Name: #{user1.name}, Country: #{user1.country.name}"
Name: Lucas, Country: Brazil
```

### Assigning variables as maps

```Elixir
samples do
   %{}  | :name       | :country        | :city
  user1 | "Christian" | "United States" | "New York City"
  user2 | "Ingrid"    | "Austria"       | "Salzburg"
end
```

### Assigning variables as keyword lists

```Elixir
samples do
    []  | :name       | :country        | :city
  user1 | "Christian" | "United States" | "New York City"
  user2 | "Ingrid"    | "Austria"       | "Salzburg"
end

```

## Other examples (WIP)

```Elixir
  truth_table = samples do
     :a   |  :b   | :and  |  :or  | :xor
    true  | true  | true  | true  | false
    true  | false | false | true  | true
    false | true  | false | true  | true
    false | false | false | false | false
  end

```
